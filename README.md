# Development

Upon launching the project in VSCode you should be prompted to install `prettier` and `eslint`, agree or install the extensions manually if the popup doesn't show.

Open VSCode settings and search for default formatter setting for the editor and set it to `Prettier`. It is also recommended to enable the "Reformat on save" option for Prettier.

You can also use other editors such as WebStorm, just install the Prettier extension and make sure it is correctly using our `.prettierrc` config file.
